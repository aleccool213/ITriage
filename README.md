How to run using adb

In terminal, browse to the directory where your Android SDK is installed. This directory contains directories add-ons, platform-tools, tools, etc.
Start your emulator by running tools/emulator -avd <avd_name> where <avd_name> is the name of an Android Virtual Device. (Run tools/android list avd to see a list of your AVDs.)
Open a new terminal window in your Android SDK directory.
Run platform-tools/adb install <path_to_apk> where <path_to_apk> is the path to iTriage.apk. If iTriage is already installed, run platform-tools/adb install -r <path_to_sdk> to reinstall.
On your virtual device, open iTriage from the app drawer.
